# Social-Media-App
This project is a full-stack social media platform that allows users to post updates, follow other users, and engage in real-time chat. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and WebSockets, it showcases my ability to develop dynamic, real-time web applications.
